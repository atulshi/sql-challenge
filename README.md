 Module 9 Challenge
 ## Background
 Itâ€™s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.  All the CSV files are stored inside an EmployeeSql folder and uploaded to the repository. The subsequent queries for the project including the pgAdmin4 data are stored inside the same folder.
